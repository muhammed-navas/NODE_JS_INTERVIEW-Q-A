**⭕Q6 --> What is Single Threaded Programming?**

(a)
* A single-threaded programming language executes code sequentially in a single thread, meaning it processes one instruction at a time .This means that if one task is taking longer, the entire program must wait, and multiple tasks cannot be processed simultaneously. 

![alt text](/assest/image2.png)


**⭕Q7 --> What is Synchronous Programming?**

(a)
* In a synchronous program, each task is performed one after the other, and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.
* Synchronous programming focuses on the order of execution in a sequential manner, while single-threaded programming focuses on the single thread.


**⭕Q8 --> What is Multi Threaded Programming?**

(a)
* Multithreaded programming involves dividing a program's execution into multiple independent threads, allowing them to run concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness. Each thread can execute its instructions independently while sharing the same memory space and resources of the parent process. 

![alt text](/assest/image3.png)


**⭕Q9 --> What is Asynchronous Programming?**

(a)
* In Node.js, asynchronous flow can be achieved by its single-threaded, non-blocking, and event-driven architecture.

* In Node.js, if there are 4 tasks(Task1, Task2, Task3, Task4) to be completed for an event. Then below steps will be executed:
1. First, Thread T1 will be created.
2. Thread T1 initiates Task1, but it won't wait for Task1 to complete. Instead, T1 proceeds to initiate Task2, then Task3 and Task4(This asynchronous execution allows T1 to efficiently handle multiple tasks concurrently).
3. Whenever Task1 completes, an event is emitted.
4. Thread T1, being event-driven, promptly responds to this event, interrupting its current task and delivering the result of Task1.


**⭕Q10 --> What is the difference between Synchronous & Asynchronous programming?**

(a)
![alt text](/assest/image4.png)


**⭕Q11 --> What are Events, Event Emitter, Event Queue, Event Loop & Event Driven?**

(a)
   * Event: Signals that something has happened in a program.
   * Event Emitter: Create or emit events.
   * Event Queue: Events emitted queued (stored) in event queue.
   * Event Handler(Event Listener): Function that responds to specific events
   * Event Loop: The event loop picks up event from the event queue and executes them in the order they were added.
   * Event Driven Architecture: It means operations in Node are drive or based by events.

**(eg)**:- project name, version, author, license, dependencies, scripts, etc.

**⭕Q16 --> What are Modules in Node?**

(a)
* In Node.js, a module is a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code. Modules help organize your application into smaller, maintainable, and testable pieces.


**⭕Q17 --> What are the Types of modules in Node?**

(a)
 1 . Built-in Modules (provided by Node.js) : example: http, fs, path, etc.

 2 . Local Modules (created by the developer) : example: myModule.js

 3 . Third-party Modules (installed via npm) : example: express, mongoose, etc.


**⭕Q18 --> What are the Top 6 built in modules commonly used in node projects? Explain the role of each module?**

(a)

1. **http**: The http module is used to create HTTP servers and clients. It allows you to set up a basic web server that can listen for incoming HTTP requests and respond to them accordingly.

const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


2. **fs**: The fs module enables interaction with the file system. It provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods to read, write, update, delete, and manage files and directories.

const fs = require('fs');

// utf8 is formate of file
fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!',utf8, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File has been saved!');
}); // Write to a file asynchronously.

fs.writeFileSync('file.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!'); // Write to a file synchronously.

const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8'); // Read a file synchronously.

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data); // Read a file asynchronously.
});

3. **path**: The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps with constructing, resolving, and normalizing paths in a platform-independent way.

const path = require('path');
const filePath = path.join('/home/user', 'Documents', 'file.txt');
console.log(filePath); // Output: /home/user/Documents/file.txt

const filePath = path.resolve('/home/user', 'Documents', 'file.txt');
console.log(filePath); // Output: /home/user/Documents/file.txt

const filePath = path.parse('/home/user/Documents/file.txt');
console.log(filePath); // Output: { root: '/', dir: '/home/user/Documents', base: 'file.txt', ext: '.txt', name: 'file' }


4. **url**: The url module allows parsing, formatting, and resolving URLs. It is especially useful when dealing with query strings or handling request URLs on the server.

const url = require('url');

const myURL = new URL('https://example.com/path/to/page?query=string');
console.log(myURL.href); // Output: https://example.com/path/to/page?query=string

const query = url.parse(myURL.search, true).query;
console.log(query); // Output: { query: 'string' }

5. **OS**: The os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties. You can retrieve system-level information such as CPU details, memory status, platform, and network interfaces.

const os = require('os');

const type = os.type();
console.log(type); // Output: Windows_NT (or Linux, macOS, etc.)

const release = os.release();
console.log(release); // Output: 10.0.19044 (or the corresponding release version)


6. **events**: The events module provides an implementation of the EventEmitter class, which allows you to define custom events and listeners. This is a key part of Node.js's event-driven architecture.

const EventEmitter = require('events');

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('Event occurred!');
});


**⭕Q19 --> What is the difference between a function and an event?**

(a) 
* A function is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task when invoked or called.
* Events represent actions that can be observed and responded to. Events will call functions internally.


**⭕Q20 --> What is the role createServer() method of http module?**

(a)

* The createServer() method of the http module in Node.js is used to create an HTTP server.

const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});


**⭕Q20 --> What are the Advantage of using Express with Node js?**

const middleware1 = (req,res,nex) =>{
    console.log('muhammed')
    next();
}
const middleware2 = (req,res,next) =>{
    console.log('navas');
    next();
}

  const app = express();

  const middleware = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware executed');
    next();
  };

  app.use(middleware);

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
  });

 ✅route-level middleware applies only to specific route , not for all imcoming request.

 const express = require('express');
 const app = express();

 const middleware = (req, res, next) => {
   console.log('Middleware executed');
   next();
 };

 app.get('/route', middleware, (req, res) => {

 });

 app.listen(3000, () => {
   console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
 });


**⭕Q26 -->  What is error handling middleware and how to implement it?**

(a)
* Error handling middleware in Express is a special kind of middleware used to manage errors happening while handling incoming requests.
* To implement error handling in Express, define middleware with four parameters (err, req, res, next). Here the additional error object parameter will be used for error handling.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');

const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const bodyparser = require('body-parser');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const compression = require('compression');

const app = express();

// use the helmet middleware for setting HTTP security headers
app.use(helmet());

// use the body-parser middleware for parsing request bodies
app.use(bodyparser.json());
app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// use the morgan middleware for logging HTTP requests
app.use(morgan('combined'));

// use the compression middleware for compressing responses
app.use(compression());

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

**⭕Q32 --> What is the difference between middleware & routing in Express?**

(a)
 ▶ middleware :- 
    *  Middleware are functions.
    * Middleware functions can access and the request and response objects, then they can
    * perform some actions (logic like authorization) 
    * End the request-response cycle 
    * Call the next middleware function in the stack.

 ▶ routing :- 
    * Routing is a process.

**⭕Q45 --> What are Authentication and Authorization?**

(a)

* Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user by validating their credentials such as username and password.

* Authorization is the process of allowing an authenticated user access to resources.
* Authentication is always precedes to Authorization.

![alt text](/assest/image23.png) ![alt text](/assest/image24.png)


**⭕Q45 --> What are the types of authentication in Node.js?**


![alt text](/assest/image25.png)


**⭕Q45 --> What is Basic Authentication?**

(a)
* In Basic Authentication, the user passes their credentials on a post request. At the Node Rest API end, credentials are verified, and response is sent back.

* The disadvantage of it is, Basic Authentication sends credentials in plain text over the network, so it is not considered a secure method of
authentication.


**⭕Q45 --> What are the security risks associated with storing passwords in plain text in Node.js?**

(a) 
*  Unauthorized Access: Storing passwords in plain text means that anyone with access to the storage location, such as a database or configuration file, can easily read and extract passwords.

* Compromise of Other Accounts: Many users tend to reuse passwords across multiple accounts, allowing attackers to access to multiple accounts.


**⭕Q45 --> What is the role of Hashing and Salt in securing passwords?**

(a)
* Hashing: Hashing is a process of converting a password into a fixed- size string of characters using a mathematical algorithm.


![alt text](/assest/image26.png) ![alt text](/assest/image27.png)


**⭕Q45 --> What is Token based and JWT authentication?**


(a)
* Token-based authentication is a method where a client proves its identity by using a token instead of sending username/password for every request. 

🧠 How It Works:

✅ Client logs in (with username & password).

✅ Server validates the credentials.

✅ Server generates a token (a string or encrypted object).

✅ The token is sent to the client.

✅ On future requests, the client sends the token in headers (usually Authorization: Bearer <token>).

✅ The server validates the token and allows or denies the request.



**⭕Q45 --> What is Error Handling? In how many ways you can do error handling in Node.js?**

(a)
* Error handling is the process of identifying and responding to errors that occur during the execution of a program.
