Q1 -->  What is node js ? 

 * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.
 * Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
 * Node.js is often used for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time applications.

( It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.)
