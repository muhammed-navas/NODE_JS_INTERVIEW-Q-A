Q1 -->  What is node js ? 

(a)
 * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.
 * Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
 * Node.js is often used for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time applications.

( It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become a popular choice for building web applications and APIs.)

Q3 --> What is the difference between a Runtime Environment and a Framework?

(a)
* Runtime Environment: Primarily focuses on providing the necessary infrastructure for code execution, including services like memory management and I/O operations.

* Framework: Primarily focuses on simplifying the development process by offering a structured set of tools, libraries, and best practices.

Q4 --> What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?

(a)
* Node.js is a runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code server-side.

* Express.js is a framework built on the top Node.js.
    * It is designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of features like simple routing system, middleware support etc.


Q5 --> What are the differences between Client-Side (Browser) and Server-Side (Node.js)?

(a)

                            Client-Side (Browser)                    Server-Side (Node.js/Server)
